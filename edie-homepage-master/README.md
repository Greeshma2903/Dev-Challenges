- What was your experience?
   - This was a very interesting challenge for me. I had planned on practicing new things on this challenge. I used dark-mode for the first time and so was the sticky header. It literally made me realize how much fun using css can be ðŸ˜ƒ
- What have you learned/improved?
   - I learned to implement dark-mode on a website.
   - Practiced sticky headers.
   - I practiced CSS Grid basics (though I still ðŸ’™ Flexbox ðŸ’ª).
   - Learnt how maintaining minimum color-contrast is important for accessibility.
   - Smooth scrolling is another concept I learnt.
- Your wisdom? :)
   - Try to make things work with Flexbox before trying Grid ðŸ˜‰
   - Dark mode option is lit
