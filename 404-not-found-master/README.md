Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

- What was your experience?
  - I was able to revise my CSS skills and practiced using semantic HTML. It was a fun little project that I was able to get done quickly.

- What have you learned/improved?
  - I learnt how to make use of **media queries** in a better way. 
  - I also improved my coding style.
  - Learnt how to make the [footer stick to the bottom](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/).

- Your wisdom? :)
  - Order in which you write **media queries** matter, so take care of it ;)
